# Changelog

All notable changes to the IBGE MCP Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.2] - 2026-06-21

Supply-chain hardening release (no functional changes).

### Changed
- **Pinned `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.29.0`** (was `^1.0.0`). The
  previous wildcard range let any 1.x resolve into the tree; narrowing it gives
  reproducible installs and a tighter supply-chain surface.

### Security
- **Published with npm provenance attestation** via the GitHub Actions release
  workflow (OIDC / SLSA). Earlier 3.0.x releases were published manually and
  carried no attestation; cutting this release through CI restores provenance,
  which Socket.dev and npm surface as a supply-chain trust signal.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-20

Naming consistency, structured output everywhere, and a hosted HTTP transport
(roadmap Phase 2 discoverability).

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Renamed the `datasaude` tool to `ibge_datasaude`.** All 22 tools now share
  the `ibge_` prefix (the lone exception is gone), which improves naming
  consistency in directories/registries and for tool selection. Update any
  client configuration or calls that referenced `datasaude`. The function,
  schema, and behavior are unchanged — only the registered tool name.

### Added
- **Structured output for every tool.** The 15 catalog/locality/listing tools
  now declare an `outputSchema` and return a typed `structuredContent` payload
  alongside the Markdown (previously only the 7 tabular tools did). All 22 tools
  now expose structured output. Additive and non-breaking — clients that ignore
  `structuredContent` still receive the same Markdown. `malhas`/`malhas_tema`
  expose lightweight metadata only (the geometry stays in the Markdown channel).
- **Hosted HTTP transport.** An optional Cloudflare Worker serves the same
  surface over Streamable HTTP at `https://ibge.sidneybissoli.com/mcp`, declared
  as a `remotes` entry in `server.json` and advertised via
  `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`. STDIO remains the default.
- **`SECURITY.md`** (read-only security model + disclosure policy) and **npm
  publish provenance** (`--provenance`) for supply-chain attestation.
- A concise **"Behavior:" line** in every tool description stating it is
  read-only/idempotent, the IBGE API it calls, and its output shape.

### Fixed
- **`ibge_paises` was broken against the live IBGE API.** The code assumed the
  wrong response shapes: `nome` is an object (`{ abreviado }`), country `id` is
  keyed `ISO-3166-1-ALPHA-2/3`, currency `id` is an object, and
  `localizacao.regiao.id` is `{ M49 }`. As a result `tipo="buscar"` threw,
  region filtering always returned empty, and names/codes rendered as
  `[object Object]`/`-`. The `Pais`/`PaisLocalizacao` types and every accessor
  were corrected.
- **`ibge_sidra_metadados`**: the table code is returned as a number by the API;
  it is now coerced to a string so the structured payload validates.
- Repointed the Glama badge to its canonical URL and fixed the dead MseeP badge
  link in both READMEs.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-19

Refocus on the project's stated principle — **IBGE specialist, no scope creep
to other sources** — plus the first discoverability work (roadmap Phase 2).

### Removed (BREAKING)
- **The `bcb` tool** (Banco Central do Brasil data) has been removed. It was the
  only non-IBGE data source and contradicted the roadmap's "IBGE specialist"
  scope; dedicated Banco Central MCP servers cover this better. Also removed the
  accompanying `cruzar-ibge-bcb` prompt, the BCB API endpoints in `config.ts`
  (SGS/PTAX/EXPECTATIVAS), the `BCB_API` alias, and the `toBcbDate` helper.
  Tool count: 23 → 22. IPCA/INPC and other price indices remain available via
  `ibge_indicadores` (IBGE is their primary source).

### Added
- **README differentiator** (roadmap 2.1): both READMEs now lead with the
  "live, exact, sourced data vs. just asking an LLM" pitch, with a concrete
  example.
- **Registry metadata / SEO** (roadmap 2.4): value-oriented `package.json`
  description and expanded keywords; `server.json` description aligned and its
  malformed indentation fixed.

### Fixed
- **Accuracy:** removed the claim that the server queries a **DataSUS** API. It
  does not — health indicators are read from IBGE's SIDRA (the `datasaude`
  tool). DataSUS is credited only as the original producer of some stats
  (mortality/births) served via SIDRA. Corrected across README, metadata, the
  `datasaude` tool description, and internal comments.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-19

This release completes **Phase 1 (usability)** of the roadmap: structured
output, parameter consistency, reliability, errors that teach, and the MCP
protocol capabilities (resources, prompts, read-only annotations).

### Added
- **MCP resources** (roadmap item 1.6): five reference catalogs exposed as
  readable `ibge://catalogos/*` resources — `ufs`, `regioes`,
  `niveis-territoriais`, `tabelas-sidra`, `biomas` — returning JSON derived from
  `config.ts` (single source of truth). Lets an agent read the lookup tables it
  needs (UF/region codes, SIDRA territorial levels & table codes, biomes)
  without guessing a code or spending a tool round-trip. Lives in
  `src/resources.ts`.
- **MCP prompts** (roadmap item 1.6): three ready-made analysis templates —
  `comparar-municipios`, `perfil-demografico` and `cruzar-ibge-bcb` — that steer
  the model through chaining the right tools, with zod-validated arguments.
  Lives in `src/prompts.ts`.
- **Read-only tool annotations** (roadmap item 1.6): all 23 tools now declare
  `readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint`/`openWorldHint` (and `destructiveHint: false`)
  via a shared `READ_ONLY` constant, so MCP clients can auto-approve or badge
  them as safe. Completes roadmap item 1.6.
- **Configurable request timeout** (roadmap item 1.4): every upstream request is
  now bounded by an `AbortController` (default 30s), overridable via the
  `IBGE_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable or per call. A timed-out request is
  retried and, if it keeps failing, surfaces a clear "Tempo de resposta
  excedido" message instead of hanging indefinitely.
- **Structured output** (roadmap item 1.2). Data tools now declare an
  `outputSchema` and return a typed `structuredContent` payload alongside the
  Markdown text, so agents can consume data without parsing Markdown. Done for
  all seven data tools — `ibge_sidra`, `ibge_censo`, `ibge_indicadores`,
  `datasaude`, `ibge_populacao`, `ibge_comparar` and `ibge_cidades` (registered
  via `server.registerTool`). A reusable pattern lives in `src/structured.ts`
  (`StructuredToolResult` + `toMcpResult`, plus a shared `sidraRecords` helper
  that turns a SIDRA response into typed `colunas`/`registros`); the remaining
  data tools can adopt it the same way.
  - `ibge_sidra` paginates large results (100 rows/page) via a new `pagina`
    input, with continuation guidance in the text channel.
  - **Field selection**: the tabular tools (`ibge_sidra`, `ibge_censo`,
    `ibge_indicadores`, `datasaude`) accept a `campos` input to keep only
    matching columns (accent/case-insensitive), shrinking both the structured
    payload and the Markdown table. Completes roadmap item 1.2.
  - Convention: success returns `structuredContent`; errors return `isError`
    (the SDK skips output validation); an empty result is success-with-empty
    payload, not an error; non-data responses (e.g. `listar` catalogs) return a
    minimal valid payload with the listing in the text channel.
  - Note: `ibge_sidra` `formato="json"` now returns the structured payload as
    JSON (was the raw SIDRA array).

### Changed
- **Errors that teach the right alternative** (roadmap item 1.4): every tool's
  error path now points at the related tool(s) to try next (e.g. `bcb` →
  `ibge_indicadores`, `ibge_municipios` → `ibge_geocodigo`/`ibge_localidade`,
  `ibge_malhas` ↔ `ibge_malhas_tema`), following the disambiguation map. Tools
  with no natural sibling (`ibge_cnae`, `ibge_nomes`, `ibge_paises`) are
  intentionally left without related-tool noise. The "no data vs real failure"
  split (empty result → `ValidationErrors.emptyResult`; real error →
  `parseHttpError`) was verified across all tools. Completes roadmap item 1.4.
- **Server construction extracted** from `index.ts` into a side-effect-free
  `createServer()` in `src/server.ts`; `index.ts` is now a thin STDIO entry.
  This makes the full MCP protocol surface testable end-to-end.
- **Standardized territorial-level (`nivel_territorial`) nomenclature** across
  `ibge_sidra`, `ibge_censo`, `ibge_datasaude` and `ibge_indicadores`. A single
  `territorialLevelHint`/`territorialLevelList` helper in `config.ts` (backed by
  `TERRITORIAL_LEVEL_LABELS`) now generates every level description and error
  suggestion, ending naming drift (e.g. "Grande Região" vs "Região") and the
  inconsistent/incomplete level lists. Each tool now declares the levels it
  actually supports (roadmap item 1.3 — completes 1.3).

- **Unified locality (UF) input** across `ibge_municipios`, `ibge_vizinhos` and
  `ibge_geocodigo`: a state can now be given by sigla (`SP`), name (`São Paulo`,
  accent/case-insensitive) or IBGE code (`35`) interchangeably. New single
  resolver `resolveUf` in `config.ts` is the source of truth; `normalizeUf`
  delegates to it. Removes a sigla-only schema constraint on `ibge_municipios`
  and a duplicated lookup map in `ibge_geocodigo` (roadmap item 1.3).
- **Unified date input format** across all date-taking tools (`bcb`, `ibge_noticias`,
  `ibge_calendario`). All now accept the canonical Brazilian `DD/MM/AAAA` (plus
  `DD-MM-AAAA` and ISO `AAAA-MM-DD`) and convert internally to each upstream API's
  required format. Previously `ibge_noticias`/`ibge_calendario` required the
  ambiguous month-first `MM-DD-AAAA`, which silently produced wrong or empty
  results. New helpers `parseUserDate` / `toBcbDate` / `toIbgeApiDate` in
  `validation.ts` centralize this (roadmap item 1.3).

  Roadmap item 1.3 (parameter consistency) is now complete.

### Tests
- Raised coverage of the priority data tools well past the ≥50% target
  (`sidra` 0→86%, `malhas` 0→95%, `indicadores` 53→87%, `censo` 51→81%, plus
  `datasaude` 16→88%): URL building, table/JSON formatting, number formatting,
  parameter validation, and graceful handling of empty results vs upstream
  failures. Adds a shared `tests/helpers.ts` mock helper (roadmap item 1.5).
- Closed the remaining coverage long tail — every tool is now ≥50%, with the
  `src/tools` directory at ~89% (`cnae`, `geocodigo`, `sidra-tabelas`,
  `noticias`, `comparar`, `paises`, `nomes`, `malhas-tema`, `populacao`,
  `pesquisas`, `vizinhos`, `cidades`, `sidra-metadados`). `cidades`/`paises`
  previously had schema-only tests and now exercise the tool functions. Suite:
  290 → 436 tests, all green.
- Added end-to-end protocol tests (`tests/server.test.ts`) that drive the real
  server over an in-memory transport and client: tool annotations, resource
  listing/reads, and prompt expansion. Plus request-timeout tests
  (`retry.test.ts`/`errors.test.ts`) and related-tools error tests
  (`integration.test.ts`). Suite: 436 → 460 tests.

### Fixed
- `ibge_censo`, `ibge_datasaude` and `ibge_indicadores` now **validate**
  `nivel_territorial` against their supported levels and return a clear
  "Nível territorial inválido" message, instead of forwarding an unsupported
  level straight to the SIDRA API.
- `ibge_calendario` now reads the real IBGE API fields (`data_divulgacao`,
  `nome_produto`): month grouping and the date column previously rendered `NaN`
  because the code referenced non-existent `data_inicio`/`produto` fields.
- Invalid dates now return a clear "Data inválida" message with the accepted
  formats instead of being passed raw to the upstream API.
